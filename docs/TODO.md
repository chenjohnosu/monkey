# Todo List

## New Code Base Migration
- need to get cursor back to print command>llm>workspace>
- changes to query>llm>workspace> when in query mode
- query batch mode prints nothing to the screen and nothing is logged


## HPC
### Migrate to HPC
- Create image with monkey/data payload in Docker
- Create Singularity instance using Docker image
- Test larger parameter batch runs

## Code Clean-Up
### Logging/Saving
- Fix what /save buffer start/stop do; currently it adds little to the code since query is already logging
