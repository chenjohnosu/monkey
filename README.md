# Monkey

Monkey is a command-line interface that supports LLMs/RAG in the following use cases:

## Use Cases
### Evaluate LLMs for Social Sciences:
- Provides a harness to test if LLMs can be used as a research tool for qualitative researchers.
- Quickly gain insights into large quantities of qualitative data (e.g., interview transcripts, open-ended survey questions, ethnography notes, and observations).
- Removes bottlenecks and inconsistencies from traditional qualitative "coding" procedures.
- Allows for changing or combining LLMs to examine data, adjust parameters like "temperature," explore boundary conditions, and develop proper prompts for use with LLMs.

### Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis:
- Offers a workbench for both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
- Enables academic researchers to conduct literature reviews quickly.
- Provides a single tool for statistical analysis/visualization (EDA) and literature review (many PDFs).

## Benefits
- Data Security: Running a local LLM/RAG helps support IRB requirements for academic research and ensures that sensitive data can be controlled and not accidentally incorporated into external training data.
- Vector Store Re-use: Researchers can share, merge, and exchange pre-processed vector stores. Can test results of multiple LLMs using the same vector store.


## Requirements
- Nvidia Graphics Card - To use CUDA for acceleration
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/ "Ollama") - Needs to be installed on the system.  
- LLMs - needs to be downloaded in Ollama ('pull')
